Get custom foreign currency exchange rates

This feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/).   This reference describes how to query custom foreign exchange rates from Zuora. You can use this API method to query exchange rates only if you use a custom exchange rate provider and upload rates with the Import Foreign Exchange Rates mass action.  

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import zuora_client
from zuora_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = zuora_client.CustomExchangeRatesApi()
currency = 'currency_example' # str | The target base currency of the tenant. The exchange rates in the response are calculated in relation to the target currency.  The value must be a three-letter currency code, for example, USD.  
start_date = 'start_date_example' # str | Start date of the date range for which you want to get exchange rates.  The date must be in yyyy-mm-dd format, for example, 2016-01-15. The start date cannot be later than the end date. 
end_date = 'end_date_example' # str | End date of the date range for which you want to get exchange rates.  The date must be in yyyy-mm-dd format, for example, 2016-01-16. The end date can be a maximum of 90 days after the start date. 
zuora_entity_ids = 'zuora_entity_ids_example' # str | An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  (optional)

try:
    # Get custom foreign currency exchange rates
    api_response = api_instance.g_et_custom_exchange_rates(currency, start_date, end_date, zuora_entity_ids=zuora_entity_ids)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling CustomExchangeRatesApi->g_et_custom_exchange_rates: %s\n" % e)
```
