If at the same time the service activation date is set as required and its value is null, a &#x60;Pending Activation&#x60; subscription will be created.  | [optional] 
**trigger_event** | **str** | Condition for the charge to become active.  If the value of this field is &#x60;SpecificDate&#x60;, use the &#x60;specificTriggerDate&#x60; field to specify the date when the charge becomes active.  | [optional]
